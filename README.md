# Multi-Processor-System-on-Chip

In this practical there is an implementation of Multi-Processor System-on-Chip. In this practical there are two cpus. Between them three is a shared memory and processors share that common memory address space and communicate with each other via memory. In the part 1 there are simple producer and simple consumer. In this MPSoC there is a software implementation to procced this scenario. In the part 2 there is a dedicated hardware FIFO queue, and this can be used to increase the performance.
